Problem Statement:
    To implement Natural Language Processing (NLP) program for an application.
Tools Used: 
    Google Collaboratory
Algorithm:
    1. Import the required modules, dependencies and load the dataset.
    2. Analyze the dataset, get shape, info check for null values and balance of the dataset.
    3. Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and data visualization.
    4. Slice the data in to features and label.
    5. Create a analyzer for the text normalization.
    a. Tokenization: Split text into list of words.
    b. Stopwords exclusion: Remove punctuation and stopwords.
    c. Stemming: Transform each word in text into its base form (lemma).
    6. Split the data into training and testing datasets.
    7. Create pipeline with vectorization and classifier as sequence of operations.
    8. Perform vectorization using analyzer.
    9. Train the models and compare the models.
