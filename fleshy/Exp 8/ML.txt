Problem Statement:
    To implement the ML algorithms for an application.
Tools Used: 
    Google Collaboratory
Algorithm:
    1. Import the required libraries such as numpy, pandas, matplotlib, etc
    2. Define the dataset, using the functions from pandas library.
    3. Plot the data points pandas based on the attributes of the dataset.
    4. Define the function to calculate the value of coefficients.
    5. Plot the error for each iteration.
    6. Predict the values.
    7. Plot the regression line.
    8. Analyze the performance of the model by calculating the mean squared error.
    9. Use the sklearn libraries to confirm the above steps.
